# pysius
Python solver for Blausius equation. It can be used in three different ways:

- as a Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/install): type `jupyter notebook` in your terminal, then navigate to the folder where `pysius.ipynb` is located and click on it.
- from your browser: open `pysius.html` to view the pre-calculated Jupyter notebook; notice that you cannot run code from here.
- with Python: run `pysius.py`.

Notice that both Python and Jupyter require matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html) and numpy (https://scipy.org/install.html).
